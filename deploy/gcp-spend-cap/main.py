"""Budget kill switch: unlink billing from the project once spend nears its budget.

Deployed by scripts/deploy-gcp.sh when CATS_SPEND_CAP=true, as a Cloud Run
function subscribed to the budget's Pub/Sub notifications. Google Cloud has no
hard spending limit; this is its documented substitute. Removing the billing
account stops every paid service in the project, so the MCP server goes
offline until billing is linked again, which re-running the deploy script does.

Cost data trails actual usage by hours, so the trigger is a fraction of the
budget (SPEND_CAP_AT, default 0.8) rather than all of it.

Environment:
    SPEND_CAP_PROJECT   Project whose billing is cut. Required.
    SPEND_CAP_AT        Fraction of the budget that triggers the cut.
    SPEND_CAP_DRY_RUN   "true" to log the decision without acting on it.
